# Etch-A-Sketch
My first JavaScript project! I created a small website that allows a user to draw pixel art on the provided canvas, with options to change the pen color, use an eraser, use a rainbow brush mode, and even just clear the canvas as a whole.

Here is a [link](https://zachhealy.github.io/etchASketch/) to get to a live version of the project.

Project inspiration from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)

### Future Plans
- Add in the ability to change the canvas size
- Add an export function
- Add an undo button
